# React Todo List

This is a simple and elegant React-based Todo List application that allows you to add, update, and delete tasks with ease. Additionally, you can switch between light and dark themes for a personalized user experience. Your todos are temporarily stored in your browser's local storage, so they persist during your session but are cleared upon refreshing or closing the page.

This project helps React developers learn basic and important concepts such as state management, event handling, conditional rendering, and working with local storage.
